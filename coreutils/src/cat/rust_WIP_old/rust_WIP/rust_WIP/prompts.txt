DefId(0:218 ~ rust[fc84]::src::fpurge::fpurge)
Chunk root
Here is a function:
```rust
pub unsafe extern "C" fn fpurge(mut fp: *mut FILE) -> libc::c_int {
    __fpurge(fp);
    return 0 as libc::c_int;
}
```


The file contains the following imports:
```rust
use ::libc;
```
Convert the function to idiomatic Rust, meaning Rust code that does not make use of features like unsafe, raw pointers, and the C API whenever possible. Do not change the function name.

Follow the following format for your output: Place the function translation between the tags <FUNC> and </FUNC>. 


Any functions or variables without definitions are defined elsewhere in the code. Do not attempt to redefine them or import them.
If you are using any new functions and you need new imports for those, place them between the tags <IMPORTS> and </IMPORTS>. This should be only *new* imports. Do not include existing imports.
DO NOT include markdown characters like "```" or "```rust" in your translation.
